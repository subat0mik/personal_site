My name is Duane Michael. I'm a security consultant specializing in penetration tests and red/purple team exercises. I hold an OSCP, OSWP, CRTP, and various other information security certifications. I am currently pursuing the OSCE, as well as a Ph.D. in computer science. My current interests are exploit development and red teaming.
