I did not anticipate my first blog post being a book review, but here we are. I recently picked up a copy of "Red Team Development and Operations" by [Joe Vest][joe-vest] and [James Tubberville][james-tubberville] on a recommendation from my good friend [@airzero24][airzero] . This book was particularly interesting to me for two reasons: 1) Joe Vest and James Tubberville are prominent names in the world of red teaming and infosec, and 2) Professionally, building out a red team capability and program are on the forefront of my endeavors. Perhaps you could say that I discovered this book at the perfect time, as it does shine light on many of the topics that I have been working through with my team.

As we started down the path of creating a red team program, we began to realize that it's not feasible to produce a red team exercise out of a framework built around delivering penetration tests. Having studied red team operations and tradecraft, I am familiar with what a red team exercise looks like from a technical operator perspective, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. _Red Team Development and Operations_ provides a thorough treatment of the documentation, procedures, and considerations to be taken when planning a red team exercise.

The book answered _almost_ every question that I had about building out the program. _How do we scope the exericse? How many operators do we need and for how long? How much time can be saved by implementing the assumed compromise model?_ and so on, and so on.

It should be noted that this is not a technical book. It will not teach you tradecraft or how to remain undetected by EDR, but it will provide you an excellent framework for building a red team. Additionally, the book has a companion [website][book-site] that contains templates, exercises, and examples to work through.

With such a short review, there is no need for a tl;dr. _Red Team Development and Operations_ has earned a spot on my desk as a go-to reference that I have been and will continue to use every day. This book is suggested reading for any red teamer, and required reading for any red team lead or manager. Support Joe and James, buy the [book][amazon-link]!
